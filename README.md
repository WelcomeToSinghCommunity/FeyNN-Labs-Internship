# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation

Welcome to the Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Segmentation project! This repository contains a detailed analysis of the electric vehicle market, focusing on sales data from two different regions: **India** and **Washington**. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks and includes interactive visualizations and insights that help understand the market dynamics.

## üìÇ Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- **`EV_Market_Segmentation_India.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook that explores the EV sales in India, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and market segmentation.
  
- **`EV_Market_Segmentation_Washington.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook focusing on the EV sales in Washington. It uses similar analysis techniques and compares trends with the Indian market.
  
- **`Electric_Vehicle_Population_Analysis_by_Kishan_Singh.ipynb`**  
  This notebook dives into the electric vehicle population, providing a deeper understanding of EV distribution.

- **`Dataset/`**  
  A folder containing all the relevant datasets used in the analysis for both India and Washington. The data is essential for replicating the analysis and building further insights.

- **`Report/`**  
  The final report summarizing the key findings of the project, including market trends, consumer adoption rates, and predictions. The report is available in both PDF and DOCX formats.

## üöó Project Overview

The project explores **electric vehicle market segmentation** by analyzing the sales trends and consumer adoption in India and Washington. The objective is to uncover patterns that drive EV adoption and to highlight factors such as:

- Regional sales patterns
- Influencing factors for EV purchases (price, range, government policies, etc.)
- Future market predictions
